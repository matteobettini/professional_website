# Professional website

My personal website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [wowchemy academic theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic)

A GitHub workflow automatically builds the website in this repository and deploys it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) on **[matteobettini.com](https://matteobettini.com)**
