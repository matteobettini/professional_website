### Hello! :wave:
#### I am Matteo, a PhD student in the Prorok Lab at the University of Cambridge.

With my sueprvisor, [Dr. Amanda Prorok](https://www.proroklab.org/), I study the problem of resilience in multi-agent and multi-robot systems. We employ techniques from the fileds of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks.

Prior to this, during my master, I investigated the problem of transport network design for multi-agent systems.
