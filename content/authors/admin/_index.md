### Hello! :wave:
#### I am Matteo, a researcher in machine learning.

My research focuses on reinforcement learning applied to multi-agent and multi-robot systems.

I am currently working on training LLM agents for long horizon tasks using reinforcement learning at Meta.

I obtained my PhD from the [Prorok Lab](https://www.proroklab.org/) at the University of Cambridge, 
were I studied heterogeneity in multi-agent and multi-robot systems and developed the [VMAS](https://github.com/proroklab/VectorizedMultiAgentSimulator) simulator. 
For this research, I employed techniques from the fields of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks.
During my PhD, I joined PyTorch at Meta, where I created [BenchMARL](https://github.com/facebookresearch/BenchMARL) and helped develop [TorchRL](https://github.com/pytorch/rl). 

For my master, I investigated the problem of transport network design for multi-agent routing.
