### Hello! :wave:
#### I am Matteo, a PhD student in the Prorok Lab at the University of Cambridge.

With my supervisor, [Amanda Prorok](https://www.proroklab.org/), I study resilience and heterogeneity in multi-agent and multi-robot systems. For my research, I employ techniques from the fields of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks.

Prior to my PhD, I investigated the problem of transport network design for multi-agent routing.
